# btst-newsapp

GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE WEB APPLICATION:

This web app uses the NEWS API to fetch data and show you the latest news and blogs around the world. 

TECH STACK USED:

Made by using Next.js and Tailwind CSS 

FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITIES:

Great user experience.

Responsive design by the use of Tailwind breakpoints.

Proper button to redirect to that blog for complete article.

Accessible on mobile screens too.

Different transitions on button and cards for soothing user experience.

CHALLENGES FACED:

The major challenge was how to display the fetched data on the article card. I implemented this using useState by storing every object in an array. Looped through the array to display corresponding information on the card.

To display every information correctly, I used the blog's url as the key which was unique in it's nature.

Responsiveness was another challenge I faced, but Tailwind's breakpoint were of great help.

Providing a great user experience was another difficulty and it took a considerable time of mine to set the background and other things in the UI.
